// Package harness defines the agent CLIs evolve can drive (Claude Code and
// OpenAI Codex): their runner-binary candidates, credential env vars, skill
// directories, command construction, and output parsing. A harness drives a model — it does not own one — so the model id a
// command targets is supplied as a harness-specific CLI string mapped from the
// canonical model (see internal/model).
//
// Capability gaps are structural: a harness implements the optional EvalRunner
// interface only when its CLI supports a gradable headless run, and engines
// type-assert and degrade. The LLM judge has no posture of its own — it reuses
// EvalSpec at the judge turn ceiling, confined by evolve's sandbox (or the
// harness's own eval sandbox when not host-sandboxed). A harness whose
// ReportsUsage is false would leave its estimate/measured fields absent
// end-to-end. OfferedModels is the same pattern for model discovery: Claude and
// Codex can report which models the operator's installed CLI actually serves
// (the account-dependent picker list), and callers fail open — a harness
// without the capability, or a failed probe, deselects nothing. Token counting
// is a vendor concern and lives in internal/model, not here.
