// Sandbox confines an agent run's filesystem writes. When Enabled, every
// command is wrapped in a bubblewrap sandbox that permits writes everywhere
// EXCEPT ProtectedRoots — the source
// repositories an escaping agent must never modify — with the per-run
// workspace always re-permitted on top. Reads and the network stay
// unrestricted on purpose: dependency tooling (go mod download, npm ci, uv
// sync, terraform init, ...) writes to caches scattered across $HOME and needs
// the network, and those caches must keep working for tools we ship today and
// tools other teams add tomorrow. The policy is therefore a denylist (protect
// the repos) rather than an allowlist (enumerate every cache), so it never has
// to know about a tool in advance.

// wrap returns argv prefixed with the bubblewrap launcher confining writes to
// everything but the protected roots, with workspace re-permitted. A disabled
// sandbox returns argv unchanged. workspace is the directory the agent runs in
// and is always writable (it is re-permitted even when it sits inside a
// protected root). wrap fails closed: an enabled sandbox that cannot be
// constructed (missing bubblewrap) returns an error rather than silently
// running the agent unconfined.
